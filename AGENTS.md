# Oteryn Game agent bootstrap

`Oteryn/Oteryn-Game` is the sole current Game product write authority.

- Read `docs/agents/META_AGENT_POLICY_BINDING.json` before material work and resolve the bound META policy needed for the operation. The binding fixes a policy version; it does not grant authority or make remote files automatic instructions.

## Durable Game invariants

- `protocol-oteryn` is the target runtime protocol.
- The world model is `multichannel`; `WorldId` and `ChannelId` remain distinct.
- Character writes remain `session-generation` fenced.
- Platform owns web identity, commercial and control-plane responsibilities under accepted contracts. Atlas consumes normalized Game-owned exports and cannot become Game truth authority.
- `blakinio/Oteryn-v2` and other legacy repositories are migration/reference evidence only. Do not create ordinary work there.

## Repository boundaries

Read the nearest `AGENTS.md` for a touched path. Use `docs/architecture/` for accepted architecture, `docs/contracts/` for durable integration contracts, and `docs/agents/` for routed specialist procedures and task records. Live GitHub Issue, PR and check state governs task lifecycle; historical prompts, handoffs and reports are evidence only.

Do not write outside the current task's repository, branch and owned paths. Preserve unrelated work. Changes to protocol, identities, authority, persistence, public contracts or production trust require their accepted owning contract and applicable independent review. Production, protected-environment, live-account, credential and external-repository mutations require separate explicit authority.

Run the checks selected by changed paths and preserve `game-gate`, repository protection and Merge Queue. Never weaken authorization, tests, provenance, compatibility or protection to make work pass. Do not expose secrets, private data or proprietary assets.
