# Shared NPC quest rewards

`content/quests/shared-reward-callbacks.json` is loaded by the Quest catalogue and
the real NPC talk dispatcher. Author records against
`shared-reward-callbacks.schema.json`; `qengine_rewards.validate_callbacks` checks
the cross-field constraints. `qengine_rewards.py --check` reproduces the twenty
source compositions and the promoted native outfit catalogue from the committed
Crystal corpus, without network access.

The existing native source importer admits the fifteen additional physical Item
profiles used by those exchanges. Its pinned Canary XML/client appearance
inputs, canonical-fact checks and exact identity bindings are recorded in
`tools/content-schema/native-gameplay/qengine-reward-item-profiles.json`.
`register_spell_families.py` retains that cohort and the cosmetics section during
ordinary native regeneration. New lanes must qualify additional referenced Item
identities through their owning content pipeline before claiming a playable
exchange; a canonical identity alone is insufficient native custody evidence.

Each record has these fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `key` | Unique `oteryn:quest-reward/<name>`; the durable transition/callback name. |
| `quest` | Owning canonical Quest key. Existing tracks must belong to this quest. |
| `npc` | Canonical `oteryn:npc.<name>`, resolved through the current conversation. |
| `keywords` | One to eight exact, trimmed, lowercase ASCII player messages. |
| `topic`, `next_topic` | Current/committed conversation topic, unsigned 16-bit integers. |
| `storage` | One to sixteen `{track, minimum, maximum, set, preserve?}` predicates/effects. Bounds are inclusive; missing progress reads as `-1`. `preserve: true` keeps that predicate's value. At least one changed value must leave its accepted range, preventing immediate repeat grants. |
| `take` | Up to eight distinct `{item, count}` requirements, counts `1..65535`, aggregated across carried stacks, equipment and closed nested containers. Filled containers and items with keys, timers, text or imbuements refuse consumption. |
| `give` | Optional/null `{item, count, contents?}`: one native reward root, count `1..100`, optionally up to twenty `{item, count}` children in a container. Native stack/container and weight rules still apply. The equipped main backpack needs room after the hand-in. |
| `outfit` | Optional/null `{outfit, addons}`. `outfit` is the canonical `oteryn:outfit.<name>`; `addons` is a bitmask `0..3`: base only `0`, first addon `1`, second addon `2`, both `3`. Base is always included. |
| `achievement` | Optional/null canonical `oteryn:achievement/<name>` from the admitted achievement catalogue. |
| `reply` | One to eight response lines, each at most 512 UTF-8 bytes. |
| `sources` | One to eight exact donor revision/path/hash citations. |

All effects share one session-generation-fenced Quest transaction and receipt.
Missing inputs, insufficient capacity, stale authority or incompatible cosmetics
refuse without partial effects. A replay returns the original committed result.
Existing account outfit unlocks retain their original immutable receipts and
satisfy subsequent character completions. Both sexes use the same outfit key;
the appearance owner selects the donor look using immutable creation sex. The
existing appearance protocol publishes the new catalogue and permits selection.

`shared-reward-offers.json` contains conversation-only records with `npc`,
`keywords`, `topic`, `next_topic`, `storage`, and `reply`. These records establish
confirmation topics and never apply storage effects. A reward's storage effects
apply only after the complete exchange commits.

The shared file is a registry, not an extra effect inside
`world-callbacks.json`. A lane adds its source-backed callback record and its
conversation offers to these registries during integration; it must preserve
the existing records and unique keys. Do not replace the shared generator's
outputs with a lane-only document.

Current compositions: `pirate-sabre`, `knight-sword`, `deepling-helmet`,
`hallowed-holy-water`, `outfox-helmet`, and `sam-backpack`, each prefixed by
`oteryn:quest-reward/`. The last is Sam's backpack hand-in and achievement;
Kroox's later permission grant is `sam-kroox`: it updates the NPC and mine-door
tracks together and does not mint armor. The armor remains a mine chest claim.

`questl2_rewards.py` adds Dorian's seven exact deliveries (`thieves-tusks`,
`thieves-vase`, `thieves-invitation`, `thieves-bridge`, `thieves-goblet`,
`thieves-fish`, `thieves-letter`) and Hairycles' six hand-ins (`ape-moss`,
`ape-syrup`, `ape-parchment`, `ape-egg`, `ape-mushroom`, `ape-hair`). Offers bind
each confirmation to its source topic and storage predicates. These are stage
definitions, not a whole-quest qualification claim. The witches' cap retains
its source 24-hour temporal facts; the existing reward owner refuses instances
with persisted timed state, so its timed hand-in is not qualified by ordinary-item tests.
