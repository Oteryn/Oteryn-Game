# Item authoring schema candidate v1

This package turns the Item Master Schema v1 census into an executable authoring
contract. It validates one portable Item definition, not a placed map object and not a
mutable item instance.

Architecture and boundaries:
[`docs/architecture/OTERYN_ITEM_AUTHORING_FORMAL_SCHEMA_V1.md`](../../../docs/architecture/OTERYN_ITEM_AUTHORING_FORMAL_SCHEMA_V1.md).

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `build_formal_schema.py` | Single source for the schemas, profile catalog and templates. |
| `item.schema.json` | One capability-composed portable Item schema for every family. |
| `item-dependencies.schema.json` | Exact definition and asset references required by the Item. |
| `item-import-readiness.schema.json` | Per-source-field mapping/disposition ledger. |
| `profile-catalog.json` | The 22 census profiles, their Wiki families and expected capabilities. |
| `wiki-field-dispositions.json` | Exact 71-field Wiki disposition registry generated from the protected census. |
| `templates/*.json` | Thirteen valid starting points for materially different authoring shapes. |
| `validate_item.py` | Structural, semantic, exact-reference and import-readiness validation. |
| `verify_formal_schema.py` | Focused positive/negative contract checks and deterministic fixtures. |

The profiles are guidance inside one schema. Missing a common capability produces a
warning; optional capabilities preserve the wider census union without warning noise.
This avoids making an exceptional but valid combination impossible. Unknown
fields fail closed, so map placement, collision, pathing, source numeric IDs and mutable
instance state cannot silently enter an Item definition.

```text
pip install -r requirements.txt
python build_formal_schema.py
python verify_formal_schema.py
python validate_item.py synthetic-valid-item.json synthetic-valid-dependencies.json --manifest synthetic-valid-import-readiness.json
```

Successful validation proves authoring shape and declared dependency closure only. It
does not prove runtime lowering, gameplay parity, corpus migration or production
activation.

Dependency closure is exact in both directions: every used reference/asset must be
declared and every declared entry must be used. Import readiness likewise requires one
disposition for every entry in each source's explicit field inventory. Wiki sources are
additionally checked against the protected 71-field owner/disposition registry and an
explicit allowed formal JSON Pointer (including array-index patterns where required).
