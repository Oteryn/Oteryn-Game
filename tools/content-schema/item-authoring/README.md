# Item authoring schema candidate v2

This package turns the Item Master Schema v1 census into an executable authoring
contract. It validates one portable Item definition, not a placed map object and not a
mutable item instance.

Architecture and boundaries:
[`docs/architecture/OTERYN_ITEM_AUTHORING_FORMAL_SCHEMA_V1.md`](../../../docs/architecture/OTERYN_ITEM_AUTHORING_FORMAL_SCHEMA_V1.md).

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `build_formal_schema.py` | Single source for the schemas, profile catalog and templates. |
| `item.schema.json` | One capability-composed portable Item schema for every family. |
| `item-dependencies.schema.json` | Exact definition and asset references required by the Item. |
| `item-import-readiness.schema.json` | Per-source-field mapping/disposition ledger. |
| `profile-catalog.json` | The 22 census profiles, their Wiki families and expected capabilities. |
| `wiki-field-dispositions.json` | Exact 71-field Wiki disposition registry generated from the protected census. |
| `fandom-field-dispositions.json` | Exact 84-row historical Fandom migration-table registry; corroboration only. |
| `canary-field-dispositions.json` | Exhaustive pinned Canary ledger: 143 parser keys plus root, nested, appearance and reverse-relation inputs. |
| `crystal-field-dispositions.json` | Exhaustive pinned Crystal ledger: 143 parser keys plus root, nested, appearance and reverse-relation inputs. |
| `source_field_catalogs.py` | Generated-ledger source of truth, aliases, defects and owner routing. |
| `templates/*.json` | Thirteen valid starting points for materially different authoring shapes. |
| `validate_item.py` | Structural, semantic, exact-reference and import-readiness validation. |
| `verify_formal_schema.py` | Focused positive/negative contract checks and deterministic fixtures. |

The profiles are guidance inside one schema. Missing a common capability produces a
warning; optional capabilities preserve the wider census union without warning noise.
This avoids making an exceptional but valid combination impossible. Unknown
fields fail closed, so map placement, collision, pathing, source numeric IDs and mutable
instance state cannot silently enter an Item definition.

```text
pip install -r requirements.txt
python build_formal_schema.py
python verify_formal_schema.py
python validate_item.py synthetic-valid-item.json synthetic-valid-dependencies.json --manifest synthetic-valid-import-readiness.json
```

Successful validation proves authoring shape and declared dependency closure only. It
does not prove runtime lowering, gameplay parity, corpus migration or production
activation.

Dependency closure is exact in both directions: every used reference/asset must be
declared and every declared entry must be used. Import readiness likewise requires one
disposition for every entry in each source's explicit field inventory. `source_profile`
selects one pinned registry; unknown fields and wrong engine revisions fail closed.
Every mapped row is restricted to an explicit formal JSON Pointer (including
array-index patterns where required). Registered-but-ineffective engine keys are
recorded as `pinned_no_effect`, and unresolved historical semantics remain
readiness-blocking rather than being guessed into gameplay truth.

The BR profile is pinned to stable source `424807`; the Fandom profile is pinned to
historical revision `1035268` and its revision SHA-1. Per-capture SHA-256 remains a
separate required digest. Value-dependent source fields carry `source_value` so the
validator can prove conditional owner routing and normalizations (including signed
weight, `unmove`/`immobile`, item type, equip events, weapon actions and weapon kinds).
