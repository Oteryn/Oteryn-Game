# GPROD-T94 — Game delivery notes

Base: `b2cfa798e3def61002d39a6da8b9de5df5aa2fd8`. Game only; no Platform files, commits or pushes.

## CONTRACT-NOTES

The owner's 2026-11-06 instruction supersedes the candidate's default-OFF rollout text: the shipped node template, deserialization default, producer and database control start enabled. Explicit disabling refuses publication. The contract lock remains candidate; this change does not assert that Platform has qualified its adapter.

The fixture sequence omits LOCKED between SCHEDULED and SETTLED. All supplied wires remain byte-exact standalone delivery goldens. Production inserts LOCKED and advances the revision before settlement; the disconnected schedule→settlement fixture pair is refused as an authority transition. No fence is relaxed to accommodate the fixture numbering.

There are no concrete owner-approved positive scoring rules or advance aggregation values in the open questions. Configuration retains these choices. Defaults publish actual reset/raid/boss history as ineligible VOID, never retrospective predictions. All target Channels are required for an approved advance binding; no first-Channel winner. `EventBinding.channel_policy` defaults to `UNANIMOUS_OR_PENDING`; an explicitly approved `ALL_TARGETS_OR_VOID` policy can withdraw a mixed terminal aggregate as SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE. Native cancellation and source loss intrinsically yield their VOID reasons, independently of positive option mappings. Boss settlement requires the actual placed boss-death receipt. Placement failure, timeout and lost ownership cannot stand in for a boss kill. Native despawning completion without the promised boss-death receipt produces native SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE evidence for a VOID fallback; a retained actual death receipt is preserved. No generic completion authorizes a killed outcome. Persistent bosses keep their source until actual death or source loss; closing a non-despawning raid schedule is not boss loss. An advertised event can lock and await a native receipt indefinitely; scheduled_end alone never settles it.

Default seasons use a persisted rolling UTC-second calendar: first start is bootstrap time +3 seconds, duration 86400 seconds (configurable range 60..31536000), freeze at end +1 second. Missed calendar periods are backfilled one per bounded pass; completeness is withheld until the calendar is caught up. Expired native tombstones suppress recapture rather than reopening old reset questions. The default challenge is `world:gathering`, ruleset/scoring revision `t94:zero-score-season-v1`, max_score=1, no positive source rules and no eligible guilds. This produces a real OPEN/FROZEN empty standings record, not fabricated guild points. Positive `SeasonBinding.rules` and eligibility must be approved before starts_at. A committed native kill uses a fixed rule award, deduplicated per season/challenge/occurrence/guild; paid/XP modifiers are not score inputs. Attribution defaults to `PRINCIPAL_ONLY` (the fenced native kill principal); an explicit pre-season `SeasonBinding.attribution=QUALIFIED_PARTY_ROSTER` can select the qualified native party roster. This does not use premium or final XP amounts as a participation test. Membership is captured inside the fenced source transaction and never reattributed by later joins/leaves. Source acceptance time is the database cut, rather than a delayed wall-clock combat timestamp.

Bindings are Game-owned database configuration, not Platform input. `SeasonBinding.attribution` defaults to `PRINCIPAL_ONLY`; allowed explicit alternative is `QUALIFIED_PARTY_ROSTER`. `game_t94_bindings.binding` stores the strict `EventBinding` / `SeasonBinding` JSON types; `approved` defaults false. Approval cuts are stamped by Game database triggers at insertion/false-to-true approval and cannot be backdated after approval. Correction acceptance after a declared closed deadline receives an immutable refusal; accepted earlier requests retain their approval cut on replay. The runtime creates conservative default bindings. Administrative positive bindings must supply exact native content, occurrence, source, immutable rules/calendar, options and complete target Channels. Published bindings and started seasons are sealed against rule/calendar/eligibility rewrites. `game_t94_corrections` accepts explicitly approved withdrawal/restoration of an existing contribution, never arbitrary scores; its terminal receipt is immutable. Final freeze refuses further corrections.

Unresolved decisions remain configurable: positive event mappings/windows/aggregation, eligible guilds, positive challenge rules/maxima, season calendar, correction deadlines, disband tombstone and actual Fury realization availability. Missing names withhold display (`[]`); they never zero scores or change authority to VOID. FROZEN records are immutable; incompatible disband display is withheld pending a versioned policy. A missing Fury realization produces SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE bound to an actual reset receipt; setting availability true does not invent a realization, and the world-family watermark remains PENDING for missing declared gate receipts. Source metadata cannot authorize an outcome.

Native receipts, immutable revisions, evidence, terminal receipts and publication/audit outbox commit under the existing semantic transaction and sealed recovery authority. A source capture semantic error rolls back its savepoint and quarantines T94 without fabricating a result. Projection ACK and audit ACK are independent. Completeness also waits for unprocessed disband display withdrawals. The Bazaar producer is absent from this base; integration must add its installed leaf to the mutual purpose-separation checks when its configuration is introduced, preserving the contract's dedicated-key rule. Event IDs 10/11 and payload tags from PR #3010 are unchanged. No capability bits, gameplay commands or public protocol message numbers are allocated. Migration: 0998 only. Resource fragment ordinals start 1698 and are integration-renumberable.

Delivery uses a durable ten-second family lease with a six-second remaining-time check before a five-second HTTP exchange. Restart retries the same retained bytes. A later LOST cleanup ACK replays the immutable native loss commit timestamp, rather than changing source evidence with ACK time. Native event decision time must be present and positive; observation time is never substituted for a missing native decision clock. A 409 quarantines the authority. Missing/unreadable epoch fence refuses delivery; it is never initialized by the producer. First-time empty-store bootstrap requires an explicitly provisioned trusted F=0 and sealed current Character authority; F>=1 refuses empty-cache bootstrap. Positive guild seasons cannot begin before native capture starts. The T94 file wrapper locks the stable parent directory and rechecks before every persist, refusing stale writers that would lower F. Explicit resync first quiesces both durable family delivery lanes (a busy lane yields a retried PENDING/refusal without changing epoch), requires a UUIDv7 request and advances beyond both database epoch and nonrollback F, persists F before sending, enumerates the complete retained correction lineage, and withholds completeness until staging is acknowledged. Ordinary restart does not mint an epoch. A restored nonempty store must first be reconciled by the Game recovery operator: `game_t94_control.recovery_generation` must equal the sealed Character generation and `reconciled=true`; the resync operation refuses to self-certify that restoration. Default policy configuration is hashed when first installed for a World; changing it requires an explicitly versioned binding/calendar rather than rewriting an active season. P90D expiry clears audit/source/display payloads in bounded batches while keeping minimal identity, hash, nonreuse and terminal controls.

## PLATFORM CONFIG

There are **no T94 environment-variable overrides**. The server uses TOML keys below. PostgreSQL tests use the existing `OTERYN_TEST_POSTGRES_ADMIN_URL` harness variable; it is not a production transport setting.

| Config key | Default |
|---|---|
| `platform.world_event_outcomes.enabled` | `true` (absent section also enabled) |
| `platform.world_event_outcomes.source_authority` | `oteryn:game:primary` |
| `platform.world_event_outcomes.client_certificate_file` | `/etc/oteryn/credentials/t94-client.crt` |
| `platform.world_event_outcomes.client_key_file` | `/etc/oteryn/credentials/t94-client.key` |
| `platform.world_event_outcomes.epoch_fence_file` | `/var/lib/oteryn-fences/t94.epoch` |
| `platform.world_event_outcomes.resync_request_id` | absent; explicit UUIDv7 requests resync |
| `platform.world_event_outcomes.defaults.fury_gate_realization_available` | `false` |
| `platform.world_event_outcomes.defaults.season_seconds` | `86400` |
| `platform.world_event_outcomes.defaults.season_advance_seconds` | `3` |
| `platform.world_event_outcomes.defaults.freeze_delay_seconds` | `1` |
| `platform.world_event_outcomes.defaults.event_window_seconds` | `1` |
| `platform.world_event_outcomes.defaults.correction_seconds` | `1` |
| `platform.world_event_outcomes.defaults.max_score` | `1` |
| `platform.world_event_outcomes.defaults.eligible_guilds` | `[]` |
| `platform.world_event_outcomes.defaults.tombstone_name` | absent (withhold unknown disband display) |
| `platform.endpoint` | required deployment SocketAddr, shared existing Platform endpoint; no invented host/port |
| `platform.peer_name` | required existing verified TLS server name |
| `platform.trust_roots_file` | required existing PEM trust roots path |

The Synology template explicitly enables T94 and uses `<BASE>/node/secrets/t94-client.crt`, `<BASE>/node/secrets/t94-client.key`, and `<BASE>/t94/epoch-fence`. These are deployment substitutions for the loader defaults above. Credentials and the initial nonrollback fence must be provisioned by the deployment owner; no embedded credentials, auto-issued trust or fallback identity exist. Keep the fence outside Character database backups. All publishers of the same source namespace must share the same nonrollback fence and a stable lock-capable parent directory; a node-local copy is not an HA substitute. An empty T94 store initializes under the sealed current Character generation only with trusted F=0. New T94 stores use projection epoch 1; provision the initial trusted F=0 file (explicit `0` or `0\n`, meaning no publication has occurred) under the existing EpochFenceFile ownership/durability rules.

Public key ID is exactly `sha256:` followed by lowercase hexadecimal SHA-256 of the **leaf certificate DER SubjectPublicKeyInfo**, exposed as `LeagueDescriptor::public_key_id()`. It is derived at credential load, not an arbitrary configured kid, and changes on key rotation. The matching private key loads from the dedicated key file. Its SPKI must differ from evidence, runtime status, account characters, character commands and public projections. Purpose name is `OTERYN_GAME_WORLD_EVENT_GUILD_SEASON`. Platform must authorize that dedicated mTLS client identity for source namespace `oteryn:game:primary` and these operations. There is no JWT/bearer signing kid, Authorization header, browser route or inbound Game listener.

| Method | Endpoint path | Feed/family | Maximum body |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/internal/v1/game-public/world-event-outcome` | `world_event_outcome` | 16384 bytes |
| POST | `/internal/v1/game-public/guild-season` | `guild_season` | 262144 bytes |
| POST | `/internal/v1/game-public/league-watermark` | watermark for either family | 512 bytes |

Transport is Game-initiated HTTP/1.1 over TLS1.3 with dedicated mTLS and verified Platform peer/trust roots, JSON canonical bodies, one in flight per family. These are HTTP feeds, not broker topics. Responses require `Cache-Control: no-store`, at most 256 body bytes; non-200 bodies are empty. Statuses are 200/400/401/409/429/503. The existing standard PLATFORM error codes 5002–5007 are reused. Retry 429/503 with retained identical bytes and bounded 1/2/4/8/10-second backoff. Connect 1 second, TLS handshake 2 seconds, complete exchange 5 seconds. No per-subject evidence or payload is logged.

Platform E2E stub inputs (unchanged):

- `docs/contracts/fixtures/world-event-guild-season/snapshots.json`: every canonical wire and SHA-256, including schedule, settlement, VOID, correction, final freeze and tied frozen guilds.
- `docs/contracts/fixtures/world-event-guild-season/README.md`: normative replay/recovery/retention scenarios and conformance requirements.
- `docs/contracts/game-events/v1/plat3_authority.proto`: audit payload definitions; family IDs remain in `GAME_EVENT_FOUNDATION_REGISTRY.json`.

Fixture publication tests replay every supplied wire through the publisher and retry/ACK path byte-exactly. They do not turn fixture hashes into native evidence or treat the omitted LOCKED revision as an allowed production transition.

### Game-owned binding configuration

These JSON keys are local Game configuration in `game_t94_bindings.binding`; they are not additional public wire members. Platform mirrors the resulting ruleset meaning and published snapshots.

| Key | Default / requirement |
|---|---|
| `EventBinding.channel_policy` | `UNANIMOUS_OR_PENDING`; explicit alternative `ALL_TARGETS_OR_VOID` |
| `EventBinding.advance_approved` | `false` |
| `EventBinding.channels` | `[]`; a raid/boss advance mapping must name every actual target Channel |
| `EventBinding.outcomes` | `{}`; positive native phase to approved option mapping |
| `EventBinding.void_reason` | absent; explicit no-advance history uses `INVALID_SOURCE`; native cancellation/loss intrinsically carry their VOID reasons |
| `EventBinding.corrections_closed` | `false` |
| `EventBinding.correction_deadline` | absent; no final freeze without a finite configured deadline and complete cut |
| `EventBinding.withdraw_display` | `false` |
| `EventBinding.occurrence_id`, `question_key`, `question` | required actual occurrence, permanent question identity, immutable strict event template |
| `SeasonBinding.attribution` | `PRINCIPAL_ONLY`; explicit alternative `QUALIFIED_PARTY_ROSTER` |
| `SeasonBinding.rules` | `{}`; fixed unpaid award per qualified native creature key |
| `SeasonBinding.eligible_guilds` | `[]` |
| `SeasonBinding.tombstone_name` | absent; withhold unknown disband display |
| `SeasonBinding.corrections_closed` | `false` |
| `SeasonBinding.correction_deadline` | absent; no final freeze without closure |
| `SeasonBinding.complete_through` | `0` (PENDING until a qualified complete cut exists) |
| `SeasonBinding.withdraw_display` | `false` |
| `SeasonBinding.season` | required immutable calendar/challenges template; initial standings empty |
| `game_t94_bindings.approved` | `false`; approval time is stamped by Game and sealed |
| `game_t94_corrections.approved` | `false`; approval cut is stamped, terminal receipt immutable |

`platform.world_event_outcomes.enabled=false` stops publication and interpretation. Already-qualified native capture can retain source inputs for later replay; retention runs independently. Source configuration that lacks accepted evidence stays PENDING. Positive seasons that start before capture bootstrap are refused rather than assigned invented zero scores.
