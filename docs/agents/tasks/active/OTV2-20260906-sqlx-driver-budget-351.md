## Outcome and authority

Provide a reviewed SQLx PostgreSQL0.9.0 driver capability that denies size-controlled allocations before exhausting the existing admission slot balance. This prerequisite does not activate B or release247. Read the accepted resource decision337/341, RESOURCE_LIMITS_REGISTRY and the exact LIVE351 lease. The implementation plan is the single canonical plan for this task.

PROVEN: protected main d9d1b566acb57b537ff901d9765c32a95110c259 contains accepted resource341 and completed registry342. Actual SQLx0.9.0 receive buffering reserves peer-announced lengths before body arrival; row count decoders and retained status/type/table storage require coverage. Preserved evidence: PR350 at0131d990eab956462b389374b2e725427c6de251, resource-blocker section. DERIVED: a private bounded PostgreSQL stream using public SQLx-core socket interfaces is the smallest candidate patch. UNKNOWN: whether the amended two-crate accounting scope suffices for every dependency. The pre-admission audit could not prove a complete untouched-TLS reservation within remaining B capacity; it did not prove impossibility. No impossibility or complete-bound claim follows from the audit.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Exact upstream crate provenance, licenses, checksum and complete patch manifest; no unrelated dependency changes.
- [ ] Checked preallocation ledger debits the same B active-slot balance, covers actual capacity and temporary overlap, and cannot mint per-connection budgets.
- [ ] Receive/send, decoded strings/vectors, status/errors, metadata/caches, retained shared backing/clones and idle/cancellation/close lifetimes are covered; ownership proves release or charged transfer.
- [ ] Hostile length/count gates precede allocation; complete accepted operation and reconnect maxima remain supported. No arbitrary cap or truncation.
- [ ] TLS modes, versions, certificate/hostname verification, features and unrelated behavior remain unchanged; complete TLS capacity/lifetime proof is the first implementation checkpoint before substantial decoder work. Exact additional dependency paths require amendment.
- [ ] Independent negative/positive allocation tests, actual configured PostgreSQL17.6 qualification, strict affected validation and complete source/delta self-review.
- [ ] Independent exact-head review, canonical CI, normal Merge Queue and protected readback before separately serialized B activation.

## High-risk authority/recovery qualification

Driver parsing/resource safety applies. New PREPARE/COMMIT authority, session/controller installation and persisted recovery interpretation are NOT_APPLICABLE: no owning Game/B/SQL surface is leased. Existing durable behavior must remain compatible; denial after possible submission cannot classify an ambiguous outcome as uncommitted or release B custody. Negative tests independently exercise malformed peer inputs and resource exhaustion without weakening unrelated validity controls.

## Excluded scope

No B/other Game runtime, SQL/migrations, Foundation, registry, workflow, rustls, other dependency, deployment/secret/live-data or external-repository edits. SQLx-core changes are restricted to the exact accounting files below; no unrelated TLS changes. Root Cargo permits only the two exact path patches, necessary workspace exclusions and lock consequences. Preserve TLS and unrelated SQLx behavior; no authentication/transport downgrade, test suppression, arbitrary default or new architecture policy. New concrete scope requires another protected allocation.

## Exact core accounting amendment

The exact sqlx-core0.9.0 import preserves upstream bytes/licenses except these permitted accounting paths: `src/net/tls/mod.rs`, `src/net/tls/tls_rustls.rs`, `src/net/mod.rs`, new `src/net/resource_budget.rs`, new `src/net/tls/resource_budget_tests.rs`, and `OTERYN_PROVENANCE.md`. Paths are relative to `vendor/sqlx-core-0.9.0/`; its other imported files remain byte-identical upstream. PostgreSQL `src/connection/tls.rs` permits accounting-only budget plumbing. Preserve TLS modes, protocol versions, certificate/hostname verification, selected features and unrelated behavior. Rustls and every other dependency remain excluded; another concrete dependency need requires a protected amendment.

Core provenance: checksum `05b44e85bf579a8eeb4ceaa77a3a523baf2bf0e9bac7e40f405d537b5d2d5ccb`, VCS `003b698e99e024f3621b8043a2426fde5b741171`, subdirectory `sqlx-core`. Issue351 comment5559999529 governs this pre-admission correction. Original352 head7140 green CI is historical; fresh allocation review/CI is required.

## Implementation / findings

NOT_STARTED / NOT_ADMITTED. No product write before Work's protected readback, exact Cargo overlap check and immutable admission grant. Parallel-first: B,338 and346 retain disjoint lanes;351 has one exclusive worktree/branch. Cargo publication/integration is serial because247 and Dependabot259/260/261 overlap. No second driver writer.

## Validation and review

Focused: allocation-denial RED/GREEN and hostile-input/lifetime matrix in the plan. Component: vendored unit tests plus all affected normal workspace tests, fmt, strict Clippy, dependency/provenance checks and governance. Actual PostgreSQL17.6 is mandatory for driver integration; unconfigured/skipped tests are not SQL proof. E2E Server Seam/live source qualification remains outside scope and unclaimed. Self-review and genuinely independent full-change parser/resource review are required before final material freeze. Exact-head canonical CI and normal protected Merge Queue/readback remain pending. Audit result and unresolved findings: NOT_STARTED.

## PR and closeout

One admitted branch/PR; Work retains publication/integration and lease-release control. Preserve immutable admission and all counters across normal merge-up and bounded windows. No force-push/rebase/reset, no-op retrigger or self-approval. Final head belongs in PR/check evidence, not a self-referential metadata commit. Work archives/releases only after terminal protected readback; technical scope insufficiency is not completion.
