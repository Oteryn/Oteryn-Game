## Goal

A Character's position inside a house persists through logout/restart via two nullable house columns on the position record (CHAR-POSITION-1).

Children (allocate from the brief's child graph; the plan row is only the family entry gate; no child of a CANDIDATE brief is allocated before the brief is ACCEPTED):

Third of HOUSE-RUNTIME-1a -> 1b -> 1c.

## Dependencies (state on main@5742f30f3, 2026-10-15)

| Dependency | State |
|---|---|
| HOUSE-RUNTIME-1b | BLOCKING (not merged) |
| CHAR-POSITION-1 | MERGED (#2006) |

Rows marked BLOCKING must merge (or be accepted/decided) before the builder's slot commit; code in owned_paths may be drafted earlier but must not assume unmerged schemas.

## owned_paths (builder edits freely)

- `apps/game-server/src/durability/character_position_house.rs`
- `apps/game-server/tests/house_runtime_position_*.rs`
- `docs/agents/evidence/HOUSE-RUNTIME-1c-*.md`
- `docs/agents/tasks/HOUSE-RUNTIME-1c.md` (this record: status and notes only)

To compile on the branch the builder may add only the module registration lines in shared `mod.rs`/`lib.rs` files; they are re-applied in the slot commit after merging main, together with every other slot-only change.

## slot_only_paths (ONLY in the final commit at the merge-queue turn, after merging main)

- apps/game-server/migrations/NNNN_character_position_house.sql (two nullable house columns)
- tools/content-migration/regenerate_content.py outputs
- content/project.json
- content/manifest.json, content/world/manifest.json
- content/content.lock.json, content/world/content.lock.json
- content/interactions/index.json
- content/world/pins/*
- Rust pins (pinned registries / fixtures regenerated from content)
- docs/contracts/PROTOCOL_OTERYN_V1_REGISTRY.json, GAME_EVENT_FOUNDATION_REGISTRY.json, RESOURCE_LIMITS_REGISTRY.json, OTERYN_GAME_ERROR_CODE_REGISTRY.json
- apps/game-server/migrations/NNNN_*.sql number (next free on main at queue turn; main ends at 0087)
- apps/game-server/src/gameplay_transport/connection.rs, mod.rs, capabilities.rs wiring
- crates/protocol-oteryn/src/lib.rs `pub mod` + registry constants
- apps/game-server/src/durability/mod.rs, domain/mod.rs, lib.rs module registration

## Wiring points (verified on origin/main 5742f30f3)

- CHAR-POSITION-1 position writer (#2006)
- house scope runtime from 1b

## Inseparable bundles (never split across PRs)

- migration + position writer + login fallback tests

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Logout inside a house restores the Character inside that house.
- [ ] If the house is gone or access lost, login falls back to the house exit deterministically.
- [ ] Columns are nullable; old rows unaffected.
- [ ] Every concurrent transition serialized (named lock or deterministic order) and losing writer typed.
- [ ] Durable state sufficient to resume after restart / session-generation change.

## Validation commands

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy -p oteryn-game-server -p oteryn-protocol-oteryn --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test -p oteryn-game-server house_runtime
cargo test -p oteryn-game-server character_position
cargo test -p oteryn-game-server --test <task>_postgres   # needs DATABASE_URL
```

## Builder instructions

- Work only in owned_paths until CP gives the queue-turn GO; then merge main, run regeneration/registry/migration numbering/wiring in ONE final slot commit.
- Push rarely and batched: one push per fix round (heavy builds per push). No status-only commits.
- Never mark the PR ready and never post `@codex review`; CP marks ready (Codex auto-reviews each push).
- Max 2 repair rounds on the PR; then CP closes and splits.
- A required edit outside owned_paths is a `cross_domain_finding` (REPORT_ONLY), not an edit.
