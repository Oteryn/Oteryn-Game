# qengine2 contract notes

Owner rule: bound each investigation or missing-fact search to ten minutes.
Use the documented conservative behavior, implement and test it, and continue.
Push each finished green quest/mechanism slice immediately; do not hold green
work longer than thirty minutes. Only focused checks, no full workspace suite.

Accepted implemented decisions (all PostgreSQL qualified and pushed):

- Dedoras: charge exactly five Sturdy Books or twenty Epaulettes, matching his
  dialogue and the selected canonical recipe. Repair donor strict-greater-than
  checks and the unreachable epaulettes keyword branch. Crystal9f5a72c,
  data-global/npc/dedoras.lua:198-224,
  sha25675b3c6e0215ce23ab7f2f6812a77d71a80d3f4ff1565a33eb3308f3c21310fd1.
- Muriel: his source offers require the addon flag that only those offers set.
  The corpus has no other writer. Bootstrap stage1 only after base completion
  and matching carried evidence, without consuming or granting; the next exact
  hand-in earns the addon. Completed stage2 cannot restart. Crystal9f5a72c,
  data-global/npc/muriel.lua:97-149,
  sha2567bd9180ba903509cb3a4a6fe01a7b73d9038eff99d15c68bf95fed5ec697d4cc.
- Oramond VotingPoints: declare only the missing read-only catalogue fact,
  retaining Oramond ownership. Donor absence is-1; use the conservative signed
  32-bit ceiling2147483647. No player progress is written by this declaration.
  Exact thresholds3/6 and second-addon priority come from Crystal9f5a72c,

All source blobs remain in the committed pinned donor corpus; no donor copies
or binaries are added. QUEST-STATUS.json retains exact tests and case markers.

- Nobleman: the donor implements the150000 carried-money choice for each addon.
  Its10000-instalment text has no executable payment branch; preserve that
  implemented one-shot behavior. Dress/coat are aliases for the same canonical
  first-addon effect; the appearance owner uses immutable sex for the actual
  look. Hat is the second addon. No bank balance pays a carried-only request.
  Crystal9f5a72c, data-global/npc/irmana.lua:50-135 and male counterpart.

- Native Quest payments reuse the complete bounded carried-coin proof profile.
  The new cause must also have its exact same-transaction Quest fee/source
  receipt; no legacy custody, ordering, epoch or Character proof is skipped.

- Royal Costume: donor XML tags looks1456/1457 as store, but the pinned source
  NPC and owner-selected quest recipe explicitly grant them for in-game tokens.
  Admit only Royal Costume as a native quest path; leave other store looks out.
  Both client appearance records exist in the admitted corpus. Exact source
  costs are15000 Silver Tokens22516 +12500 Gold Tokens22721 for base, then
  7500+6250 each for shield and crown, in that order. Do not use the total-package
  30000/25000 dialogue number as the base-only price. Source Crystal9f5a72c,

  sha256b617d51111abedf07a4b5de72acc938153152695517ef46b894b7b37873fdadc.

- Pirate keeps the existing shared OutfitAndAddon quest ownership of its source
  base/sabre/hat and DefaultStart tracks. Do not reassign them to the title alias.
  Reuse Morgan's already-delivered firebird stage4->5; implement Duncan's exact
  three100-item hand-ins and both NPC introductions before claiming the whole
  outfit story. Only the Shattered Isles parent objective flags are arranged as
  external prerequisites in the test; no internal outfit stages are seeded.

- L1-05 Oriental: Crystal9f5a72c NPC ishina.lua:60-94 (sha2569eb2e869db4d0dfad8f04fc171773dcf9045e35647bd4069f9e9b18dc0513c71), habdel.lua:60-93 (0666e7207a7fd9565f5311ffc3d87f9b138c858117d802c089a7d00c727c7b78), miraia.lua:57-155 (7114cc53c7119cd7a42947a5be07611956e11e7f7c8833f68197f136be5e353f), razan.lua:57-149 (c12e695654ada3a5f4b1775657835fa18e5957b0870e735803a5ead2e7483acb). Exact comb5945x1; then ape fur5883x100,fish fins5895x100,wings5891x2,blue cloth5912x100. Both gender paths retain the existing shared addon owner. The door retains Oriental owner; source simultaneous write uses a generic atomic participant, never a reassigned track or detached follow-up.
- Source first introduction requires Explorer Society OrcPowder>=35; only that other lane's prerequisite is arranged by the test. Immutable sex guards all reachable authored stages; wrong-sex advisory offers confer no authority and the native commit rejects before writes/costs. Existing physical profiles for four materials are reused; only comb custody was missing. No new donor fact was inferred.

- L1-05B Norseman/Formorgar shared outfit reward: Crystal9f5a72c data-global/npc/hjaern.lua:107-155,189-197 sha2564e9e42e8daf616fe8c5ef71cfd0a4ac0ae0ae5d7bd786c80ccb2c26286d40466. At Questline39 and all four Obelisks5, take frost charm7289x1;write Questline40,Mission12=6,YakchalDoor1 and shared NorsemanOutfit1/DefaultStart1 atomically. Then exact5shards7290 lead40->41,reward41->42/addon1;exact10shards lead42->43,reward43->44/addon2. General owns NorsemanOutfit and DefaultStart;IceIslands retains other flags. Only pre-outfit parentQuestline39/Obelisks5 are arranged;no outfit stage is seeded. Father11 write remains untouched.
- Item name correction: imports/canary/items-xml/items.xml:18927 at pinned sha2561cf2992cdd7cc5b97bcf930b8c89676ec1627170008e995fd2576110e26022f2 names7289 frost charm,19oz,no charges/duration/fluid. Earlier scratch note called it spirit container;IDs/costs were unchanged. Reuse existing7290 physical profile;promote only7289 custody.

- Canonical identity clarification: the admitted source catalogue has Pirate/Norseman outfit paths under `oteryn:quest.outfit_and_addon_quests`;there are no separate native quest records with the earlier scratch dedicated Pirate/Norseman URI spellings. Original L1 title keys/counts are retained;metadata now names the verified shared owner rather than implying a separately admitted record. Norseman progress also uses existing IceIslands owner. This changes no runtime data or finished reward behavior. Evidence: content/quests/missions/quest-state.json source track ownership and the qualified PG receipt/state assertions.

- Nobleman does have dedicated catalogue identity `oteryn:quest.nobleman_outfits_quest`;its source state still uses General. Pirate/Norseman lack separate dedicated records in the admitted definition shards. Native ownership evidence: content/quests/missions/quest-state.json:1 sha25665b74015fd8af6c4f1e4074d5166a5cc56e45d52e0e564da9a83fa202e7f6100. Catalogue identity and state owner are distinct;both are now recorded accurately.
